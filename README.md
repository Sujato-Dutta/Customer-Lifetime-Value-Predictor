# 🧠 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Predictor

Predict and optimize customer lifetime value using a fully automated, end-to-end machine learning pipeline. This solution empowers businesses to understand future revenue potential from their existing customer base, enabling strategic decision-making for retention, acquisition and personalized marketing.


## 📌 Objective

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the most critical metrics in customer-centric businesses. This project aims to:

* **Accurately predict CLV** for individual customers using historical purchase behavior and customer attributes.
* **Enable real-time inference** via a scalable API and interactive dashboard.

## 💼 Business Impact

🔹 **Customer Segmentation** – Identify high-value customers and tailor offers.

🔹 **Churn Prevention** – Proactively retain customers projected to bring high value.

🔹 **Marketing ROI** – Allocate marketing spend effectively based on predicted CLV.

🔹 **Revenue Forecasting** – Better financial planning with forward-looking insights.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **📦 Data Storage**
   Raw transactional and customer data stored in **Supabase PostgreSQL**.

2. **🔁 ETL Pipeline**

   * Extract → Transform → Load (ETL) pipeline written in Python.
   * Cleaned and structured data ready for training.

3. **🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Understanding purchase behavior, segment patterns, and outliers.

4. **⚙️ Feature Engineering & Preprocessing**

   * Numerical and categorical features processed using a modular, leakage-free pipeline.
   * Preprocessor saved and reused to ensure consistency in training and inference.

5. **📈 Model Training**

   * Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` using `RandomizedSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
   * Evaluated using RMSE and R² scores.

6. **📊 MLflow Tracking**

   * Automatically logs:

     * Parameters
     * Evaluation metrics
     * Artifacts (model, preprocessor)

7. **📊 Streamlit Dashboard**

   * Real-time interactive dashboard to predict CLV.

8. **🐳 Dockerization**

    * Streamlit app containerized for portability and consistency.
    * Image pushed to Docker Hub.

9. **🤖 CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

    * Automates build, test, and deploy workflows.
    * Deploys directly to Railway minimal manual effort.
